Introduction to the Decentralized Betting on eSports Tournaments
The Decentralized Betting on eSports Tournaments project provides a blockchain-based platform for users to bet on the outcomes of eSports tournaments. It leverages the Aptos blockchain to ensure that all bets are transparent, secure, and immutable. The contract allows tournament organizers to create betting pools, and participants can place bets on specific outcomes of these tournaments.

This decentralized system removes the need for intermediaries, offering a direct, peer-to-peer betting experience, while the blockchain ensures transparency and fairness. The contract uses Aptos Coin (APT) as the currency for placing bets.
 Vision

The vision of the Decentralized eSports Betting platform is to provide a trustless and transparent ecosystem for users to participate in betting for their favorite eSports teams and tournaments. By using smart contracts and blockchain technology, we aim to:
- Create a decentralized and secure betting environment for eSports tournaments.
- Enable seamless integration with the Aptos blockchain for fast, scalable transactions.
- Offer players and users a fair and transparent way to place bets, track outcomes, and ensure that funds are securely handled.
The project aims to provide an alternative to traditional, centralized betting platforms by providing better control, more security, and enhanced transparency.

 Future Goals
While the current version of the project allows for basic betting functionality, there are several areas where we plan to expand the system in the future:
1. Betting Settlements: Add the ability to settle bets after a tournament has concluded and automatically distribute winnings to users who bet on the correct outcome.
2. Multilingual Support: Make the platform accessible to a wider global audience by supporting multiple languages.
3. Betting Deadlines: Introduce deadlines for placing bets before a tournament begins or at specific cutoff points.
4. Betting Odds and Multiple Outcomes: Allow for more complex betting scenarios, such as multiple outcomes (e.g., a draw, more than two teams), and offer dynamically calculated odds based on total pool bets.
5. Integration with Frontend: Develop a user-friendly frontend for interacting with the betting smart contract, enabling easy access to tournaments, betting options, and transaction histories.
6. Scalability: Explore integration with other blockchain networks to make the betting platform more scalable and accessible to a wider audience.
7. Governance: Implement decentralized governance for allowing the community to vote on important decisions related to the platformâ€™s features, betting rules, and more.

 Deployed Address
The Decentralized Betting on eSports Tournaments smart contract has been deployed on the Aptos testnet and is ready for integration and testing.
- Deployed Address: `0x00822102e8d0b7ac90d78c0255d7961d6b8edfc9aeaa3ff94a13cc16a13c2fdc`
Please note that this is a testnet deployment, and users can interact with the contract in a non-production environment for development and testing purposes. 
 
 How to Use the Smart Contract
1. Create a Betting Pool: Tournament organizers can create a betting pool by specifying the outcome they are betting on (e.g., which team will win). Use the `create_betting_pool` function.
2. Place a Bet: Bettors can place bets on a specific outcome of the tournament. Users must specify the outcome they are betting on and the amount they wish to wager. Use the `place_bet` function to interact with the contract.
We encourage developers and enthusiasts to explore the project and provide feedback to help us build a more robust and decentralized betting platform.
